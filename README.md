## Customer Behavior Analysis and Campaign Prediction

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer data to understand customer behavior patterns and build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will continue participating in a campaign.

### Data
* **Data Source:** The dataset contains customer information, purchase history, and campaign participation details.
* **Data Structure:** The data is organized in a CSV file with columns such as customer ID, demographics, purchase amount, purchase frequency, campaign ID, and campaign duration.

### Data Preparation
* **Data Cleaning:** The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values (imputation or removal), outliers (capping or flooring), and inconsistencies in data formats.
* **Feature Engineering:** New features are created based on existing data, such as customer lifetime value, purchase recency, and campaign engagement metrics.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* **Summary Statistics:** Descriptive statistics are calculated for numerical variables to understand central tendencies and dispersion.
* **Data Visualization:** Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are used to visualize data distributions, relationships between variables, and identify potential patterns.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Customer segmentation is performed based on purchasing behavior, demographics, or other relevant factors to identify distinct customer groups.

### Machine Learning Model
* **Model Selection:** A logistic regression model is chosen due to its suitability for binary classification problems and interpretability.
* **Model Training:** The model is trained on a portion of the dataset using techniques like feature scaling and cross-validation.
* **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

### Results and Insights
* **Model Performance:** The model achieves 96 accuracy in predicting customer campaign continuation.
* **Customer Insights:** Analysis of customer segments reveals distinct behavior patterns and preferences.
* **Recommendations:** Based on the model and insights, recommendations are made for targeted marketing campaigns, customer retention strategies, and product development.
